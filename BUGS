- The panic button (CTRL+Q) makes the game crash

- Starting xp for NPC and monsters does not give them level ups

- Object size is not correct. Mephit wings are way bigger and do not move anymore. Deamon Lord too (Uses same model)

- Not sure if this is a bug: If egoboo finds a script error when running a module with the Debug version (as opposed to the release binary),
  the game crashes. (something to do with assert failed in script.c line 478)
  Solution: Running the game in release binary shows where the script error is and you can fix it.

- Changing video settings, Save&Return to menu, then returning to video menu shows settings are not changed...
workaround: restart game to get it correct or change settings manually in setup.txt

- Screenshots don't work (New camera?)

- When loading a saved game, then exiting the saved game, and then
 starting a new player you get a message: "Press space to respawn" and
 
pressing space does nothing.


Workaround: when you want to start a new player after loading a saved game,
completely exit egoboo and start it again.


- Items that are dropped are thrown out with a too high force. While coins do the opposite
when dropped.

- Whenever a spellbook is dropped, it plays the wrong animation sequence. Currently it
runs the spellbok burns away when dropped.

- Hp meters are buggy when changed

- "killed" objects still run AI scripts.

- The options menu is buggy. It doesnt save and sometimes load settings correctly.
workaround: change settings manually in setup.txt (altough opening the setup menu will change
some settings, even if you do not specify it to do so)

- SetTargetToNearestBlahID doesn't work correctly. It targets anything.
