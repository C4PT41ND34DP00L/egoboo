- Changing video settings, Save&Return to menu, then returning to video menu shows settings are not changed...

- Screenshots don't work (New camera?)

- When loading a saved game, then exiting the saved game, and then
 starting a new player you get a message: "Press space to respawn" and
 
pressing space does nothing.


Workaround: when you want to start a new player after loading a saved game,
completely exit egoboo and start it again.


- Items that are dropped are thrown out with a too high force. While coins do the opposite
when dropped.

- Whenever a spellbook is dropped, it plays the wrong animation sequence. Currently it
runs the spellbok burns away when dropped.

- Items inside chests/(inventories?) can still spawn particles. (Still running AI scripts?)
