/// @brief An enumeration of winding modes.
/// @remark
/// The projection of a polygon to window coordinates is said to have clockwise winding if an
/// imaginary object following the path from its first vertex, its second vertex, and so on, to its
/// last vertex, and finally back to its first vertex, moves in a clockwise direction about the
/// interior of the polygon. The polygon's winding is said to be anticlockwise if the imaginary
/// object following the same path moves in a anticlockwise direction about the interior of the
/// polygon.
///
/// The winding mode specifies whether polygons with clockwise winding in window coordinates, or
/// anticlockwise winding in window coordinates, are taken to be front-facing. Certain operations -
/// in particular but not restricted to culling and tesselation - are influenced by the polygon
/// winding.
